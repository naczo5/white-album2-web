# PARSING — Leaf WA2 scenario `.txt` format (as implemented)

Source: 205 + 49 Shift-JIS token streams from KCAP `en.pak` archives
(MAO-TLs v2.1.0). Zero newlines per file; in-text breaks are literal
`\n`, page breaks literal `\k`. Comma-separated with `"` quote awareness.

## Token kinds

| shape | event |
|---|---|
| `""` | noop |
| `"..."` | dialogue (`say`, speaker = latch) |
| bare `Name` + quoted next | speaker latch |
| bare text | narration |
| `mvNN` | movie cue |
| `<img>.tga` + `bak`/`grp` | image cue + layer (also `.ani` + layer) |
| `<name>.AMP` | fullscreen color-grade filter (exact LUT in data/luts.json) |
| `N. text` runs | choice UI (option 1 = fall through) |
| bare `NNNN[_NNN]` | preload HINT (flow-neutral; proof: `2016` at 2015:1, else the documented 2015:212 choice would be unreachable) |
| `CATCH`/`CATCH2`/`CATCH3` | voice/sync marker (flow-neutral; 174/176 mid-file) |
| `<F16"...">`, `[F16...]` | whisper-size line/span (italic, MAO v2.1.0 reader parity) |
| other `<F..>`/`[S..]` | stripped, text kept |
| `<Wn>`/`[Wn]` | per-char timing, stripped |
| `[Rbase^reading]`, `[Rbase\|reading]` | ruby (both separators occur) |

## Mega-tokens (the hard part)

987 tokens across 153 files merge whole conversations (`"A~,B,"C",D,…`)
because quote parity breaks around structural tokens. `resplit_mega`
recovers display units: structural cut (`mv/tga/AMP/CATCH/ids/options/
layers`), then `,Name,` speaker cuts (~240-name validated latch census;
see `valid_name`), `\k` page
cuts; fragments classified by edge quotes (dialogue iff opens/unbalanced).
Adjacent 1-option choices merge (options interleaved with speaker tags).

This recovered 5 walkthrough-documented choices invisible to naive
parsing (2004 accept/decline, 2013 today/tomorrow, 2014 talk/leave,
2503 concert/stay, 3003 propose/together).

## Voice addressing

Every say/narrate event carries `tok`: the raw comma-token index in its
source file. Voice clips are addressed `{script}_{tok:04d}` (XOR-decoded
VOICE.PAK names), so resplit fragments share their parent token's voice
(played once, on the first fragment). Verified: 1008 tok199 and 2001
tok19 match clip content exactly.

## `.bnr` presentation bytecode (LSCR, decoded statically)

Each `NNN.bnr` (LZSS in en.pak) is a u32-LE statement stream split on the
`(6,30)` boundary. Push tags: `(5,3,X)` int, `(5,4,F)` float; ops are
`(2|3|4|6, arg)` pairs. `(3,X)` counters follow the JP token stream
(JP `2001.txt` has 773 tokens vs EN 374 — align via fractional position,
not raw index). Decoders: tools/proto_bgm.py (report:
tools/proto_bgm_report.md), tools/build_bgm.py (timeline),
tools/decode_bnr.py (fades/cams).

| shape | meaning | confidence |
|---|---|---|
| `(5,3,track),(5,3,fade),(5,3,1),(5,3,255),(4,158)` | BGM play `BGM_%03d` | high (exe call chain + census) |
| same pushes + `(6,23)` prefix | BGM play (channel variant) | high |
| `(fade,1,255),(4,5),(3,X),(4,158)` | BGM stop (fade varies) | high |
| track `0` | pause → normalized to stop | medium (exe `BGM-PAUSE`) |
| `(5,3,mode),(5,3,1000),(6,16)` | backdrop fade, 1000 ms | high (shape; player applies, capped) |
| `(6,27)…(5,4,float)…(6,18)` | camera/zoom | medium (reference only) |
| `(5,3,1),(4,132)` etc. | dialogue-line marker | high (445×/2001) |
| `(5,3,0),(5,3,SCRIPT),(4,137)` | script load/jump | high |
| `(5,3,X),(5,3,0),(5,3,0),(4,194)` | timed wait | medium |

SE triggers unmapped: ascending integer runs below the SE.PAK entry count
in voice-adjacent records (1008_030.bnr body offsets 5029-5485, X in
447..817, each 1×, all < 1132 yet > token count) are the leading
candidates, but corpus-wide filters catch JP token counters just as easily
(false positives verified), so nothing is emitted. The `(5,4,F)` tag and
`(6,21)/(6,19)` neighbors are the next static leads. `.bnr` files contain
zero filenames (only ASCII run in any `.bnr` is `LSCR`) but address `.txt`
by token index (verified: 1008_030 image anchors 44/46/65/67/90/92/107/109
occur exactly 2× each).

## Display granularity assumption (needs play-test)

One fragment = one advance. Plain narration tokens are comma-free by
construction, so comma-piece granularity only affects mega content.
QA item: compare click counts per scene vs the PC build (docs/QA.md).
